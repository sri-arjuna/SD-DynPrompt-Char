Vulvar Contour:

"The vulvar contour refers to the overall shape and outline of the vulva. It is the silhouette of the female genitalia, encompassing the labia majora, labia minora, and clitoral area. The vulvar contour can vary from person to person, and it may be influenced by factors such as genetics and body composition. It can appear sleek, graceful, and well-proportioned, reflecting the natural and unique characteristics of the individual."
Labial Crease:

"A labial crease is a subtle fold or indentation that forms along the length of the labia majora, the outer lips of the vulva. This crease can become more noticeable when wearing snug-fitting clothing or swimwear. The labial crease is a natural aspect of female anatomy and may appear more or less pronounced in different individuals. It is formed where the labia majora gently fold over and create a visible line, which can vary in prominence."
Vulvar Cleft:

"The vulvar cleft is the natural groove or division between the labia majora, the outer 'lips' of the vulva. It is a normal and distinct part of female anatomy, where the labia majora meet at the center, forming a V-shaped separation. The vulvar cleft provides protection for the inner labia minora and clitoral area. It is a unique and characteristic feature that varies in appearance among individuals."
