# SD DynPrompt - Char

In my conquest to get "an easy as possible" prompt, with as many things "automated" as possible, "SD DynPrompt Char" is just one of multiple packages.

It is ment to be either "standalone" if you want to define your backgrounds on your own, or as dependency if you want to use my "SD DynPrompt Landscape XL" which provides stunning and awesome landscape prompts.



# Structure - Basic

You can call either of these keyword: 
char/race:		This will provide keyword to represent ANY race at random, see below if you want to access different races specificly.
char/body:		From athletic or curvy to slender or thin, anything but fat or obese. (if you want those, feel free to add them to the textfiles yourself!)
char/body-sfw		This will not containt any keywords that might trigger the automatic detection of CivitAI.com (as in, avoid TOS violation when used with celebrities)
char/dress		This will dress the female in regular "tame" clothing. (SD will still show cleavage at times).
char/dress-sexy		This will dress the female in various sexy, skimpy or even naughty clothing.
